# Architecture and product decisions

Short record of decisions that shape the Corporate Website implementation. The canonical register is in the Paxofi PKDMS; this file mirrors decisions that change the code.

## D-001 — Careers and recruitment live on career.paxofi.com (2 Oct 2026)

**Decision (owner, Paxofi Technologies):** everything concerning careers and recruitment (open roles, applications, CVs, applicant communication, retention) is handled by the careers site at `https://career.paxofi.com`. The corporate website does not collect job applications.

**Consequences**
- `/careers` on the corporate site describes working at Paxofi and links to `https://career.paxofi.com` (`SITE.careersUrl` in `frontend/lib/site.ts`); an E2E test asserts the link and that the page has no form.
- Application handling on the corporate API (WBS 013.05–013.10, 013.12: submission service, validation, persistence, status model, security controls, audit events, tests) is out of scope. CV/media upload for applications is not needed here.
- The `career_applications` table from migration 001 is unused and stays empty. It is kept to avoid an unnecessary schema change on production; drop it in a later migration if the careers site never needs it here.
- `GET /api/v1/careers` (published opportunities) remains available but is not used by the website; review it together with the careers site's needs.
- Applicant personal data never reaches the corporate database, so the corporate privacy notice and retention periods (SRS Appendix J) cover enquiries only.
